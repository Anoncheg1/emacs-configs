# How to remove space character after Abbrev completion?

as pointed out in documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/autotype/Skeleton-Language.html>
you can use -1 in skeleton, like this:

    (define-skeleton chinese-dot
      ""
      "" -1 "ã€‚")
    (define-abbrev-table 'org-mode-abbrev-table
      '(
        ("." "" chinese-dot) ;; or use: C-x 8 RET IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP
        ))

To prevent new line after insertion use:

    (setq skeleton-end-newline nil)

# How to bind TAB key to Expansion function in org-mode and don't break org-cycle?

One of approaches is to bind TAB key for check if the pointer is
 located at the Org header then execute one safe expansion or org-cycle only.
And if the pointer is not on the header then use more aggressive expansion function.

    (defun my/org-tab ()
      "expand abbrevs with TAB key and don't break org-cycle"
      (interactive)
      (if (org-match-line org-outline-regexp)
          (if (not (expand-abbrev)) ;; if on header try abbrevs only
              (call-interactively 'org-cycle))
        ;; else - if not on header use other expander
        (if (not (call-interactively 'hippie-expand))
                (call-interactively 'org-cycle)) ;; useful for Tables
        )
      )
    
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
                               (local-set-key (kbd "TAB") 'my/org-tab)))

But expand-abbrev have a bug and expand even when if abbrev located at previous line.

To prevent this behavior we use

    (looking-back "\n\\** ?" 10)

that will return t if we at the begining of Org header.

Here is full code:

    (defun my/org-tab ()
      "expand abbrevs with TAB key and don't break org-cycle"
      (interactive)
      ;; if on header close to *** begining of header
      (if (and (org-match-line org-outline-regexp)
               (save-excursion (looking-back "\n\\** ?" 10))) ;; fix for expand-abbrev
          (call-interactively 'org-cycle)
        ;; else far in header
        (if (org-match-line org-outline-regexp)
            (if (not (expand-abbrev)) ;; if on header try abbrevs only
                (call-interactively 'org-cycle)
              )
          ;; else - if not on header use hippie expander
          (if (not (call-interactively 'expand-abbrev))
              (if (not (call-interactively 'company-complete))
                  (call-interactively 'org-cycle)  ;; useful for org Tables
                ))
          )
        )
      )
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
                               (local-set-key (kbd "TAB") 'my/org-tab)))

# How to use regex template for isearch with C-M-s command, e.g. search in Org headers?

When we add hook we use LOCAL flag to use hook per mode, to be able add template per mode.

org-goto is default search in Org headers but it have many disadvantages, here is our replacement for it:

    (defun my/org-header-search ()
      (if isearch-regexp
          (progn
            (setq isearch-case-fold-search 1)   ; make searches case insensitive
            (setq case-fold-search 1)   ; make searches case insensitive
            (isearch-push-state)
            ;; (setq string "^*.*")
            (let ((string "^*.*"))
              (isearch-process-search-string
               string (mapconcat 'isearch-text-char-description string ""))))))
    
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
      (add-hook 'isearch-mode-hook 'my/org-header-search nil t) ;; LOCAL = t
    )

# How to set timeout on Org-mode code block execution by C-c C-c?

    (defun my/time-call (time-call &rest args)
         (let ((org-babel-python-command "/usr/bin/timeout 15 python"))
           (apply time-call args)))
       (advice-add 'org-babel-python-evaluate-external-process :around #'my/time-call)

Sadly, it doesn't work with :session and require per language configuration.

We can fix it by adding our code before every code blocks that will be executed:

    (defun my/f-call (func-call &rest args)
      (let ((body
            (concat  "import signal
    
    # Register an handler for the timeout
    def handler(signum, frame):
        print(\"Forever is over!\")
        raise Exception(\"end of time\")
    
    # Register the signal function handler
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
    
    # Define a timeout for your function
    signal.alarm(15) # timeout 15 seconds
    " (car args)))
            (params (cdr args)))
    
      (apply func-call body params)))

# How to indent region line by line

We need to apply function to every line of region:

    (defun apply-command-to-region (command)
      "Apply FUNCTION to each line in the region."
      (let ((start (region-beginning)) (end (region-end)))

# How to prevent changing of window title for specific files?

Normally you use emacsclient and emacs &#x2013;daemon. What if you need to
 open file, keep window title and dont mess with buffers?

Just use &#x2013;name argument for emacs command! Here is my .bash\_aliases
 file, this alias set title to name of file:

    em() {  emacs --name "$(pwd)/ $1" "$@" ; }

For dynamic title use frame-title-format variable:

    (setq-default frame-title-format
          '((:eval (if (buffer-file-name)
                       (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name))

# How to open https links in Org mode with shell command for external browser?

C-c C-o command that call (org-open-at-point) when cursor at the
 link. Then it calls calls (org-link-open) which uses the variable
 "org-link-parameters".

1.  We will use org-mode-hook that will be call at opening of every file.
2.  We create variable per buffer "mybookmarksfile"
3.  if file has -**- mybookmarksfile:t -**- as a first line we will call browser for url

Firefox can not open url from command line, that is why I just copy link to buffer.

    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
                               (defvar-local mybookmarksfile nil) ;; bookmark browser activator

# How in Org-mode to hide other headers and leave current open without hiding text and headers in opened?

(org-fold-show-entry) and Outline in (outline-show-entry) don't show
 headers and text in open headers after execution, it is called "sparse trees".

This key is used exactly for fixing that hidden text and headers:

-   C-c C-r reveal context around point (org-fold-reveal)

There is strange parameters in (org-reveal) required '(4) to be passed to work right, idk why.

For Org mode:

    (defun my/org-fold-hide-other ()
         "Hide other headers and reveal current and don't hide headers and text in opened ones."
         (interactive)
         (save-excursion
           (org-overview) ;; hide others
           (org-reveal '(4)))) ;; reveal current place appropriate)
    
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
                               (local-set-key (kbd "C-c e") 'my/org-fold-hide-other)))

For outline mode:

    (defun my/outline-hide-other ()
         "Hide other headers and don't hide headers and text in opened ones.
    like (outline-hide-other)"
         (interactive)
         (save-excursion
           (outline-hide-sublevels 1) ;; hide all, set level to required!
           (outline-show-children) ;; show headers, not shure how and wehere,
           (outline-back-to-heading t) ;; to header in depths
           (outline-show-entry) ;; show local text
           (outline-up-heading 1 t) ;; go upper
           (while ( > (funcall outline-level) 1) ;; while not at first header
               (outline-show-entry)
               (outline-show-children) ;; show subheaders
               (outline-up-heading 1 t) ;; go upper
               ))
    (add-hook 'outline-mode-hook (lambda ()

# How to prevent evaluation of Org source blocks during export

# (partial) Org: How to prevent returning to begining of #+begin\_src after C-m C-/ and C-m, org-return?

This is because of org-return -> org&#x2013;newline -> (newline nil 1) -> electric-indent-post-self-insert-function -> indent-according-to-mode()
 indent-for-tab-command ->
 org-babel-do-key-sequence-in-edit-buffer("\\11") -> (org-babel-do-in-edit-buffer -> org-edit-src-code

At least we can do not use indent-according-to-mode when open new line.

Here we create new line and use simple (indent-relative) to previous line without calling org-babel dependent indentation.

    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
         (local-set-key (kbd "C-m") (lambda () (interactive) (newline) (indent-relative) ) )))

There is fuzzy package with fast search but it don't have Levenshtein

In ~/.emacs:

    (setq fuzzy-match-accept-length-difference 0)

To activate:

    M-x turn-on-fuzzy-isearch
    M-: (fuzzy-isearch-activate)
    C-s guangua

There is fzf command line utility and integration with Emacs <https://github.com/bling/fzf.el>

# How to prevent fill-paragraph in Org mode to indent source block according to language

How to force fill-paragraph to use just local fill-column and don't use babel?

Solution: just set variable fill-paragraph-function to nil. This is set to org-fill-paragraph.

For example:

    (defun my/fill-paragraph (arg)
    "Fix two things: 1) return cursor after prefix to the beginning.
    2) with C-u M-q use fill-column instead of org source block specific."
      (interactive "P")
      (if current-prefix-arg ; if C-u
        (let ((saved-fill-paragraph-function fill-paragraph-function))
          (setq fill-paragraph-function nil)
          (setq current-prefix-arg nil)
          (call-interactively 'fill-paragraph)
          (setq fill-paragraph-function saved-fill-paragraph-function))
        ;; else
        (call-interactively 'fill-paragraph)))

# \`fill-paragraph' and \`org-fill-paragraph' don't work in Org-mode list.

It breaks when new line have ^text&#x2026; and works when ^  text.. - have some spaces.
   I think the source of the problem lies in the function \`org-element-at-point'.

solution1: The main idea is to replace occurrences of \n with SPC in
 the list item to fill before calling org-fill-paragraph on it.
 <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2735/how-to-format-fill-poorly-formatted-bullet-items-in-org-mode>

Solution 2:

1.  repeat: go to the next line. If next line is not blank, not list
    and just a text, replace \n with ' '
2.  finally fill-paragraph

    (defun current-line-blank ()
      "Return non-nil if line is empty line."
      (eq (progn (end-of-line) (point)) (progn (beginning-of-line) (point)) ))

      "Return boolean, non-nil if line is a list in Org mode."
      (or (eq (org-element-type (org-element-property :parent (org-element-at-point))) 'plain-list)
          (eq (org-element-type (org-element-at-point)) 'plain-list)))
    
    (defun my/fill-paragraph-list ()
      "Fix for list in Org mode.
    Properly apply fill-paragraph in Org mode."
      (interactive)
      ;; go backward - cases: 1 at list, 2 uder list, 3 at paragraph
      (when (not (current-line-list)) ; 1
        (forward-line -1)
        (while (let ((r (and (not (current-line-blank))

                             (eq (org-element-type (org-element-at-point)) 'paragraph))))

# Themes: How to activate theme per mode or buffer or per file?

Solution: Check current buffer major-mode at opening new file event and with timer.

    (defun my/change-theme ()

# Dired: how to tweek opening file with "o" key #'dired-find-file-other-window?

Executeion path: dired-find-file-other-window ->
 find-file-other-window -> (find-file-noselect ;
 switch-to-buffer-other-window -> pop-to-buffer->display-buffer)

So all we need is configure #'display-buffer function. <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Choosing-Window.html>

This function uses display-buffer-base-action variable with high priority. That
 is why we should set this variable local and unset after.

Use default display-buffer-fallback-action as base for your config.

# How emacs behavior differ when run under root?

C-<tab> (C-TAB) and <tab> (TAB) is the same.  . <return> is Enter, RET is C-m.)

-   TAB is ascii C-i. ,
-   "<tab>","<return>" is the Return, Tab key while emacs runs in a graphical user interface.
-   "RET" is the Return key while emacs runs in a terminal.
-   "RET" is also equivalent to "C-m" (Ctrl+m).
-   "TAB" is also equivalent to "C-i", in both graphical user interface
    and terminal. If you define key by "TAB", it also defines "C-i" (and
    vice versa), in both graphical user interface and terminal.

# Abort minibuffer everywhere if C-g pressed.

# How to use TAB for templates, and don't install Yasnippet and others?

There is **Abbrevs** feature that replace word before cursor with
 something. And there is **Skeletons** languages for tamplates that
 insert some text and can prompt for user input.  They can be used
 together.

Steps:

1.  we define skeleton template with **define-skeleton**
2.  we define **define-abbrev-table** with link to skeleton
3.  we call **expand-abbrev** function

There is a little problem, TAB key is overloaded with indentation, Org
 staff and we want to add **expand-abbrev** function to this.

M-x list-abbrevs - to get list of defined templates.

Full code (greeTAB -> greetings!):

    (define-skeleton example
      "Define skeleton template."
      "" "greetings!")
    
    ;; Abbrev table for Org-mode
    (define-abbrev-table 'org-mode-abbrev-table
      '(
        ("gree" "" example)
      ))
    
    ;; TAB key rebinding
    (defun my/indent-or-complete (arg)
      (interactive "P")
      (if (or (looking-back "\\." 1) (looking-at "\\_>")) ;; if character before cursor is last one of a word or dot (.)
          (progn
            (if (not (expand-abbrev)) ;; try abbrev first
                (if (not (completion-at-point))
                    (progn
                      (company-complete-common)
                      )
                  )
              )
            )
        ;; else
        (execute-extended-command nil "indent-for-tab-command" nil) ; cycle line
      ))
    
    (global-set-key (kbd "TAB") #'my/indent-or-complete)

You can also use company mode to show you available abbrevs.

In this code we add company-abbrev to list of company-backends that
 define priority for recomendations in Org mode.

    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
                               (setq company-backends
                                     '(company-math-symbols-unicode
                                       company-capf company-keywords
                                       company-files company-abbrev
                                       company-dabbrev))))

# How to make tab-bar-mode behave like tabs in browsers and show buffer-menu?

Solution with external tab-bar-buffers package:

    M-x package-install RET tab-bar-buffers

Add to ~/.emacs :

    (tab-bar-buffers-mode t)
    (tab-bar-mode t)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-a") #'tab-previous) ; shadow beginning-of-defun
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-e") #'tab-next) ; shadow end-of-defun

But tab-bar-buffers have bugs for now.

Alternative is to use tabs per window and show buffers with same mode.
This may be even better solution:

    (global-tab-line-mode t)
    (setopt tab-line-tabs-function #'tab-line-tabs-mode-buffers)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-a") #'tab-line-switch-to-prev-tab) ; shadow beginning-of-defun
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-e") #'tab-line-switch-to-next-tab) ; shadow end-of-defun

C-M-a/e used in some modes like c-mode, you should unset it.

    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook (lambda ()
      (local-unset-key (kbd "C-M-a")) ; used for tabs ; beginning-of-defun
      (local-unset-key (kbd "C-M-e"))
    )

Ways to select:

1.  C-spc C-s .emacs.d C-n M-w ; activate selection and search forward
2.  write custom function for expand-region
3.  C-x SPC  ; activate rectangle
